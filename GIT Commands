 git config -l : Shows info about the core and the user
git add        : Stages changes for commit.
git  add -p    : Shows you the changes to be staged (it will ask you if you want to stage them or not)
git branch     : Lists all branches of your repo
git branch -d 'branch' : Deletes the existing branch(if it is fully merged)
git branch -D 'branch' : Deletes the existing branch even if it is not fully merged  .
git commit -m  : Commits staged changes with a specified message.
git commit -a -m: Stages any changes to tracked files and commit them in one step.
