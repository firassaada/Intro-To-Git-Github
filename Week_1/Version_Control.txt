A Version Control System keeps track of the changes that we make to our files.
By using a VCS, we can know when the changes were made and who made them.
It also lets us easily revert a change if it turned out not to be a good idea. 
A VCS even provides a mechanism to allow the author of a commit to record
why the change was made, including what bugs, tickets or issues were fixed by
the change. This information can be a lifesaver when trying to understand a
complex series of changes, or to debug some obscure issue.
