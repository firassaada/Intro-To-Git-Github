A Git project will consist of three sections:
*The Git directory :
The Git directory contains the history of all the files and changes.

*The working tree  :
The working tree contains the current state of the project, including any
changes that we've made. 

*The staging area  :
the staging area contains the changes that
have been marked to be included in the next commit. 

When we operate with Git, our files can be either tracked or untracked.Each track file can be in one of three main states, modified, staged or committed :
 *Modified : 
  If a file is in the modified state, it means that we've made changes to it that we haven't added or committed yet. 
 
 *Staged   :
  The next step is to stage those changes.When we do this, our modified files become stage files.
  In other words,the changes to those files are ready to be committed to the project

 *Commited :
  When a file gets committed, the changes made to it are safely stored in a snapshot in the Git directory. 
When committing new files or changes with git commit, the user is asked to provide a commit message. If an empty commit message is entered, the commit will be aborted
